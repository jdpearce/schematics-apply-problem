# Getting Started With Schematics

This repository is intended to illustrate a problem with testing the `apply`/`mergeWith` rule only by using `callRule` rather than running the entire schematic.

### Unit Testing

`npm run test` will run the unit tests, using Jasmine as a runner and test framework.

When you run the tests, the index test will pass but the `applyTemplateFiles.spec.ts` test will fail with an error like this:

```bash
Failures:
1) checkProjectExists Rule should apply the files to the tree
  Message:
    TypeError: Cannot read property 'path' of undefined

2 specs, 1 failure
```

The origin of this error seems to suggest that context is expected which isn't being provided by `callRule` ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
